# Quadratic Equations Solver

This solver helps so find real roots for quadratic equations. 

# How to Use

Rewrite equation in form of a * x ^ 2 + b * x + c = 0 and pass a,b,c to a function get_roots(a, b, c). 

# How to Launch Tests

```bash
python tests.py
```

# Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes. Training course for web-developers - [DEVMAN.org](https://devman.org)
